Exercise 1.

Created two functions eval and typeOf. Both take in ABE and return an (Either String ABE)
these are used together within our "interp" function. typeOf checks the parsed
input and determines if the types being called on certain functions are correct.
If not it returns a Left with an error message. Else it returns a Right that is
then allows the parsed input to be passed into eval.


Exercise 2.

An "optimize" function was written to optimize all functions being covered within
"eval". For this I took what was completed in Exercise1 and just simply
applied optimize to the parsed input before passing the input into eval. This
can be seen by taking a look at the "interp" function. So this is both type
checking and then optimizing the code before evaluating it.
