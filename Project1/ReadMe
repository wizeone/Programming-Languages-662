Homework 1

Instructions:
Navigate to folder destination. Run GHCi and load (:l) the file
ParserExercise2.hs. An interpreter was created and the code can be
tested by running similar examples as seen below.

A couple additional features were added such as OR, Geq, etc...

interp "2+2"
interp "4-3"
interp "4*2"
interp "6/2"
interp "if 2 <= 3 then 5 else 6"
interp "if true then 1 else 2"


For some reason

interp "+2" returns 2. I believe this is because it's being
recognized as a Num instead of Plus, thus the eval is just
calling the (Num x) = (Num x)

But that being said. interp "*2" performs as expected and throws an
error. Not sure what the difference between the two is.
